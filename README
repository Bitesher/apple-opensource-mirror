These scripts helps you download and extract packages from
opensource.apple.com or even maintain an extracted mirror with the
latest open source packages from a Mac OS X release (10.8.1 by
default).

Note that the .tar.gz will not be saved; only its extracted contents.

Prerequisite:

 sudo gem install plist minitar

Usage:

Run "./mirror.rb" to list all available packages.
Run "./mirror.rb package1 package2 ..." to download package1, package2
and so on.
The script will skip packages that have already been downloaded.

To mirror all packages in a certain OS X release from
opensource.apple.com, you can run the following command:
  ./fetch.sh 10.8.1

As of 10.8.1, the CF and WebKit2 packages are missing, and a full
mirror uses about 2.1 GB of disk space.
