This script helps you download packages from opensource.apple.com or
even maintain a mirror with the latest open source packages from a Mac
OS X release (10.7.4 by default). 

Usage:

Run "./mirror.rb" to list all available packages.
Run "./mirror.rb package1 package2 ..." to download package1, package2
and so on.
The script will skip packages that have already been downloaded.

To mirror opensource.apple.com, you can run the following command:
  ./mirror.rb | grep -v '^#' | xargs ./mirror.rb
